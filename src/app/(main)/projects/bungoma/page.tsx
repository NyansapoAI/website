            In 2015, the Uwezo learning assessments evaluated the foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) skills of 
            children between ages of 6-16 across Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (Nakabugo, 2015). 
            According to the Uwezo learning assessments <span className="text-primary font-bold">3/10 children</span> between ages of 
            6-16 in East Africa cannot read Grade 2-level stories with comprehension. 
            The study also revealed some of the major factors that are influencing 
            FLN education in East Africa. Communities where most children could not 
            read were in poor, arid, semi-arid communities with limited resources (Virginia et al., 2022). 
            Other important factors were socio-economic status like mothers education, home source 
            of lighting etc. Children of mothers with secondary education and higher displayed higher 
            literacy and numeracy skills compared to other children. Similarly, children in homes where 
            electricity was the source of energy outperformed the other children (Nakabugo, 2015).

            The read, count and shine project is a commmunity-based FLN program that targets, train and 
            empower teachers, parents and children for FLN education in communities. 
            Together with our partners we are implementing a Nyansapo AI FLN program powered by our 
            Nyansapo AI platform in <span className="text-primary font-bold">20 primary schools </span> in Bungoma, Kenya tagerting <span className="text-primary font-bold">5000 children</span>. 
            We are working with and training <span className="text-primary font-bold">40 school teachers</span> and teaching volunteer to implement 
            an FLN intervention as an after school hours program.

                Her journey with education is being significantly transformed by Nyansapo AI, an innovative learning tool that 
                has become an integral part of her daily life. Zawadiâ€™s story is a testament to the power of education and the
